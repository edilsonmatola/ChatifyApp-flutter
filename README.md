# **Chatify App - Realtime Chat App with Flutter and Firebase**

This is a realtime chat application built with Flutter and Firebase. The app allows users to create accounts, find and add friends, and send and receive messages in real time with enriched User-Experience.

It uses Firebase Cloud Firestore as well as the Firebase Authentication and Firebase Storage package which equips this app with a cloud-based NoSQL database and secure authentication methods.

# **Features**

**Authentication**: Users can create accounts, sign in, and sign out using their email and password.
**Realtime Messaging**: Users can send and receive messages in real time.
**Search and Add Friends**: Users can search for other users by email address and add them as friends.
**User Profile**: Users can view their own profile, edit their profile picture, and view their friend list.
